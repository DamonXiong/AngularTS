# AngularTS

A TypeScript Declaration Source File for the AngularJS project

### Acknowledgement

This started as a clone of Mark Rendel's project, but I wanted to take it in a slightly different direction.

## Get it on NuGet!

    Install-Package Schmulik.AngularTS
	
The files will be installed to /Scripts/AngularTS/.

## Usage

Within Visual Studio, add a reference to angular.d.ts.

	/// <reference path="AngularTS/angular.d.ts" />
